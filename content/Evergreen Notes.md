# Evergreen Notes
Evergreen Notes are [[atomic]] notes written and organised to evolve, contribute and accumulate over time. They are part of a [[digital garden]] which contains multiple interlinked [[atomic]] notes often referred to as "seeds".

**Principles of Evergreen Notes:**
- Evergreen Notes should be [[atomic]]
- They should be [[concept-oriented]]
- The notes should be [[densely linked]]

These principles are similar to [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann)â€™s [[Zettelkasaten]] method. There are subtle [[similarities and differences between Evergreen Notes and Zettelkasten]]

[[Evergreen Notes Are Like APIs]].
