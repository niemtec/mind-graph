# Creat choices, make choices

The creative process in a nutshell:
![creative process](http://gordonbrander.com/media/IDEO_Diverge_Converge_Process.jpg)

1. **Create choices**: this is a generative frame of mind. Suspend judgement and analysis. Breadth over depth. You're building up raw material. [[Brainstorming]] is a good tool here.
2. **Make choices**: trim, edit, modularize, winnow, polish. This is a reductive frame of mind. Your goal is to take the raw material and form it into a polished concept.

This process is also sometimes called blue sky, brass tacks:

**Blue sky**: what's the best outcome we can imagine? No limits, no constraints.
**Brass tacks**: how do we get there? What are our constraints? What resources and tools do we have available? This is were you start planning, using methods like [[Charlie Kindel's 5 Ps]].

These 2 stages also map to problem-solving methodologies used by design and engineering.

**Design** uses a range of strategies from both stages. Intuition, and creative strategies like moodboards, form finding, and [[Brainstorming]] are used to **create choices**. Iteration, design reviews, critique are used to **make choices**.

Production **engineering** is typically a process of **making choices** for implementation. It uses a strategy of modularizing problems â€” breaking problems into smaller parts, then solving each part. It can also be exploratory. [[Prototyping]] can be a process of creating choices when you take the [[build to think]] approach.

It's essential to know which stage of the process you're in, and whether to use a generative or a critical process. If you winnow before you sow, you'll have nothing to show.
