# Digital Garden
A digital garden is a collection of interconnected [[Evergreen Notes]] which can be used to explore various branches of knowledge.

The notes stored inside a digital garden are not meant to be static; the concept is designed around the notes growing and evolving as new information is discovered. In order to facilitate said growth, the notes are meant to be [[atomic]].
