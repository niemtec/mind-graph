# Evergreen Notes Are Like APIs

When [[evergreen-notes]] are factored and titled effectively, those titles become an abstraction for the note — the entire note’s ideas can be referenced using its title.

  [[separation-of-concerns]] (notes should be [[atomic]])
- [[sharp-titles]] (prefer note titles with complete phrases)
- Positive Framings (prefer positive note titles to promote [[systematic-theory]]
