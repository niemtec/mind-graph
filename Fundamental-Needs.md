# Fundamental Needs

Fundamental needs are universal constraints. 

Gordon Brander's Predictions:
- If a technology addresses a fundamental need, universal adoption is guaranteed. The only questions are "how fast"  and "who will build it"
- Any tech that addresses a fundamental need will be a driving force of societal change in the long term
