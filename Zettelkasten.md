# Zettelkasten
A method of knowledge management and note taking primarily used for research and study. 

"Zettelkasten" is a German word meaning "slip box", the name comes from the original approach to the system using index cards and boxes.

The idea behind the system is that [[atomic]] notes are written on the index cards with references to other cards in order to create links between ideas.
