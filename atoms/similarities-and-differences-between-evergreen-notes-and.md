# Similarities and Differences Between Evergreen Notes and Zettelkasten
[[evergreen-notes]] have been inspired by [[Niklas-Luhmann]]’s [[zettelkasten]] practice.

## Similarities:
- [[evergreen-notes]] are [[concept-oriented]]
- Atomicity, the notes should be [[atomic]]
- Greater emphasis is placed on [[densely-linked]] notes
- The [[notes-should-surprise-you]]
- The emphasis on using your own words to describe other people’s ideas

## Differences:
- Spaced repetition is a tool used to incrementally develop linkings between notes (digital notes can have greater freedom for updating linkages)
- A “[[notes-inbox]]” which is used to capture transient and incomplete notes to transition them into integrated [[evergreen-notes]]
- Back links are used to implicitly define nodes
