# Travelling Salesman Problem
The travelling salesman problem (abbreviated TSP) is a theoretical problem in Computer Science which asks: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"

It is an [[np-hard]] problem typically approached using combinatorial optimisation.
