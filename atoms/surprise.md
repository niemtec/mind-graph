# Surprise
A brief mental and physiological state (a startle response) experienced as a result of an unexpected event. Surprise can occur in varying levels of intensity ranging from very-surprised, which may induce the fight-or-flight response, or little-surprise that elicits a less intense response to the stimuli.
