# Agape
A universal [[love]] such as that for nature, strangers or fellow man. It does not depend on familiarity and encompasses the modern concept of altruism - the unselfish concern for the welfare of others.

In [[philosophy]], agape refers to the paternal love of God for man and of man for God. Agape arguably draws on elements from both [[eros]] and [[philia]] in that it seeks a perfect kind of [[love]] that is at once a fondness, a transcending of the particular, and a passion without the necessity of reciprocity.

The love of God requires absolute devotion that is reminiscent of [[Plato]]’s love of Beauty, which involves an erotic passion, awe, and desire that transcends earthly cares and obstacles. 
[[Aquinas]], on the other hand, picked up on the Aristotelian ([[Aristotle]]) theories of friendship and [[love]] to proclaim God as the most rational being and hence the most deserving of one’s [[love]], respect, and considerations.
