# Pain
Physical pain is a subjective sensation experienced when a signal travels through nerve fibers to the [[brain]]. The experience is different for every person and can differ in duration and intensity which makes it challenging to define and treat.

## Psychological Pain
Mental pain often stems from a non-physical origin, sometimes argued to be an inescapable aspect of human existence.[^1] The experience of mental pain is far wider and subjective than physical pain as there are a wider range of possible causes, most of which are poorly understood.

Psychological pain is often linked to [[emotions]] and the results of biochemical interactions in the [[brain]]. It can also be brought about by various mental disorders or mental phenomena.
