Anger is a potent emotion, often experienced when we feel attacked, decieved, frustrated, invalidated or treated unfairly. Despite oftentimes being classified as a "bad" emotion, it can have its uses, serving as a motivating force for achieving goals and bringing about a positive change. 

A person experiencing anger will often experience physical effects, such as increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and increased levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, [[body language]], physiological responses, and at times public acts of aggression. 

Anger causes a reduction in cognitive ability and the accurate processing of external stimuli. Dangers seem smaller, actions seem less risky, ventures seem more likely to succeed, and unfortunate events seem less likely.
