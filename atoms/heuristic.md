A heuristic is a name given to an approach to a problem which employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be perfect but proves sufficient to reach an approximate answer.

Referred to as a “rule of thumb”.

In scenarios where finding optimal solutions is impractical or impossible (e.g. the [[travelling salesman problem]]), heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution (a good enough answer).

Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision.
