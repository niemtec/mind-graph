# Love
The term "love" encompasses a wide range of strong and positive [[emotions]]. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment, however there are also types of love such as that of a mother for her child, the love of a spouse or even the love of food - all of those have "love" in common, though it manifests in very different ways.
