# Polynomial Problem
A Polynomial problem is one where the smallest number of steps to find an answer is always less than some [[polynomial]] function of the length of the problem. 

We consider that a pretty easy problem, because even if it takes a lot of steps, at least if we have a really big example of that problem the number of steps isn't that much larger than a small example of that problem.
