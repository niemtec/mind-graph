# Body Language
The unspoken element of communication which is used to reveal [[feelings]] and [[emotions]] through gestures, facial expressions and posture.

When we are able to "read" these signs, we can use it to our advantage. For example, it can help us to understand the complete message of what someone is trying to say to us, and to enhance our awareness of people's reactions to what we say and do.
