# Punctuated Equilibrium
Complex systems exist in punctuated [[equilibrium]], repeatedly [[evolution|evolving]] through distinct phases of [[randomness]], growth, consolidation, and collapse.

**Phase 1, [[random]]ness**: the system is unstructured. [[random]]ness events occur without particularly changing the structure.

**Phase 2, Growth**: an innovation causes a major phase transition within the structure of the system. The innovation catalyses other innovations in a positive feedback loop.

**Phase 3, Consolidation**: growth rates saturate. The ecosystem consolidates into a highly organised network, optimised for efficiency as each [[agent]]s seeks to eye out as much as it can from its position in the value chain. Hubs ([[keystone-species]]) appear at critical points.

**Phase 4, Collapse**: a random shock, or new innovation demolishes one of the [[keystone-species]], causing [[cascade-failure]] within the highly structured network. The ecosystem collapses into a random structure.
