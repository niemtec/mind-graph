# Time
Time is familiar to everyone, yet it's hard to define and understand. Science, [[philosophy]], religion, and the arts have different definitions of time, but the system of measuring it is relatively consistent.

The basis for measuring time using hours, minutes and seconds has changed throughout history (tracing all the way back to ancient Sumeria), the modern international unit of time, the second, is defined by the electronic transition of the cesium atom.

Physicists define time as the **progression of events from the past to the present into the future**. If a system is unchanging, it is basically timeless. Time can be considered to be the fourth dimension of reality, used to describe the progression of events three-dimensional space - it's not something we can see, touch or taste, but we can measure its passage. Physics equations work equally well whether time is moving forward into the future (positive time) or backward into the past (negative time.) However, time in the natural world has one direction, called the arrow of time.

## Reversing time
The question of whether time is reversible is one of the biggest unresolved questions in science, one explanation is that the natural world follows the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. 

The second law of thermodynamics states that within a closed system, the entropy of the system remains constant or increases. If the universe is considered to be a closed system, its entropy (degree of disorder) can never decrease. In other words, the universe cannot return to exactly the same state in which it was at an earlier point. Time cannot move backward.
