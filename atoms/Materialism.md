A form of philosophical [[monoism]] which holds matter to be the fundamental substance in nature, and all things, including [[mental states]] and [[consciousness]], are results of material interactions.

According to philosophical materialism, mind and [[consciousness]] are by-products of material processes such as the [[biochemistry]] of the [[human brain]] and nervous system, without which they cannot exist. 
This concept directly contrasts with [[idealism]], where mind and [[consciousness]] are first-order realities to which matter is subject and material interactions are secondary.
