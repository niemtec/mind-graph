[Richard Feynman was a polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), who did pioneering work in the Manhatten Project, quantum physics, parallel computing, and nanotechnology.

He boiled his technique down into 4 steps:
1. Find a concept
2. On a piece of paper, write an explanation of the concept using simple words — the way you would teach it to a child
3. When you encounter a gap, or find yourself resorting to big words and tricky concepts, go back to the source material. Re-learn, until you can explain it in simple terms.
4. Share it with people
