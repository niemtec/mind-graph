# Be Approximately Right
> Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.

Consider the value of an answer along 2 axes: [[accuracy]] and [[precision]].

High [[accuracy]], low [[precision]] — "Pi is 3.14"
High [[precision]], low [[accuracy]] — "Pi is 5.230394891123039491203157"
