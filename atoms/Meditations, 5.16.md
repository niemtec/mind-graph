> “Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions.”—
> [[Marcus Aurelius]]

* If you hold a perpetually negative outlook, soon enough everything you encounter will seem negative. Close it off and you’ll become closed-minded. Color it with the wrong thoughts and your life will be dyed the same.
