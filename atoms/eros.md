# Eros
From the Greek *erasthai*, refers to the part of [[love]] constituting a passionate, intense desire for something. Oftentimes referred to as a sexual desire (hence the word "erotic" from Greek *erotikos*).

[[Plato]], however, thinks of eros as a common desire that seeks transcendental beauty. The particular beatuy of an individual is meant to remind us of true beauty that exists in the [[World of Forms]].
