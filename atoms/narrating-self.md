# Narrating Self

The narrating self is forever busy spinning stories about the past and making plans for the future. It doesn’t narrate everything, and usually weaves the story using only peak moments and end results.

The narrating self doesn’t aggregate experiences – it averages them. Nevertheless, most of us identify with our narrating self. When we say ‘I’, we mean the story in our head, not the onrushing stream of experiences we undergo.

This gives rise to the questionable liberal belief that I am an individual, and that I possess a clear and consistent inner voice that provides meaning to the entire universe.
