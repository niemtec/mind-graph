A thermodynamic property that is the measure of a systemâ€™s thermal energy per unit of temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work. It is often interpreted as the degree of disorder or [[randomness]] in the system.

$$S = k_b \ln\Omega$$ $$ S = entropy,;; k_b = Boltzmann;constant,;; \ln = natural;logarithm,;; \Omega = number;of;microscopic;configurations $$

Entropy, like temperature, pressure and volume is a thermodynamic property but, unlike them, it can not easily be visualised.
