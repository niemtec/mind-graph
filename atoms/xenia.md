Is an ancient Greek sacred rule of hospitality - hence guest love - the generosity and courtesy shown to those who are far from home or associates.

It constitutes two basic rules:
1. **The respect from hosts to guests**: hosts must be hospitable to guests and provide them with a bath, food, drink, gifts, and safe escort to their next destination. It is considered rude to ask guests questions, or even to ask who they are, before they have finished the meal provided to them.
2. **The respect from guests to hosts**: guests must be courteous to their hosts and not be a threat or burden. Guests are expected to provide stories and news from the outside world. Most importantly, guests are expected to reciprocate if their hosts ever call upon them in their homes.
