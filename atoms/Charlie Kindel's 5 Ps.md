Charlie Kindel's [5 Ps for starting a project](http://ceklog.kindel.com/2011/06/14/the-5-ps-achieving-focus-in-any-endeavor/):
1. **Purpose**:    
   Why do we exist? Why are we in business? Where do we want to be in the future? What will we deliver?

2. **Principles**:    
   What are the non-negotiable rules and key strategies? How will we act?

3. **Priorities**:    
   What is the framework for tradeoffs?

4. **Plan**:    
   How are we going to stage and tackle solving the problems? What are the known dates and forcing functions on the calendar?
   
5. **People**:    
   Who is accountable for every key part of the plan?
