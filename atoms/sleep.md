# Sleep

The "recycle rate" within the brain of a human being is about 16 hours. After being awake for 16 hours, the [[brain]] beginds to fail. In order to address that, humans need more than 7 hours of [[sleep]] each night to maintain sufficient cognitive performance.

After 10 days of just 7 hours of [[sleep]], the [[brain]] is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without [[sleep]] for 24 hours.

Three full nights of recovery [[sleep]] (i.e., more nights than a weekend) are insufficient to restore performance back to normal levels after a week of short sleeping.

> "Poor [[sleep]] quality therefore increases the risk of [[cancer]] development and, if cancer is established, provides a virulent fertilizer for its rapid and more rampant growth."
