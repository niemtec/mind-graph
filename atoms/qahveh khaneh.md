# Qahveh Khaneh
A name given to a [[coffee]] house in the Arabian Peninsula around #C15 which began to appear across the Near East around that time.

Those became extremely popular not only due to the beverage they served but also as a social hub for entertainment and gossip. Coffee houses quickly became such an important centre for the exchange of information that they were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise.”
