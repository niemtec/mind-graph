# Temporal Distortion

The fragmentation of linear narrative which can sometimes be experienced as the elongation of percieved time. Temporal distortion can, be defined as the gap between how time passes (objectively) and how we experience it (subjectively).

[[Time Perception]] has been conceptualised according to theoretical models which posited a biological stopwatch in the brain which would slow and accelerate in line with our attention or arousal. Thus subjectively making [[time]] appear to dialate or contract.

Functional MRI reveals that large networks of neural areas underly time processing. These structures are likely affected by our experience of [[emotions]] which play a role in our perception of the flow of [[time]] depending on how we feel. 

Csikszentmihalyi famously coined the term “[[flow]]” to describe the experience of being so happily immersed in an activity that all distractions are shut out. A key feature of the [[flow]] experience is a distorted sense of [[time]] — typically a feeling that time has passed faster than usual.

The sheer pursuit of rewards, from experiences to material goods, is an ingredient for temporal illusions. 

Experiencing [[fear]] has shown to have an effect on our experience of [[time]] given that threatening stimuli (the most innately disturbing forms of novelty) cause intense physiological reaction which can distort our internal sense of the passage of [[time]].
