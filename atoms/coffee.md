# Coffee
Brewed from roasted beans (seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the [[Coffea]] genus), roasting transforms the raw, green, beans into a consumable product that is roasted coffee. This can be ground into fine particles for brewing.

Coffee’s stimulating effect is due to the presence of [[caffeine]].

The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are _[C. arabica](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Coffea_arabica "Coffea arabica")_ and _[C. robusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Robusta_coffee "Robusta coffee")_.

## History
### Legendary origins
The origins of coffee can be traced back to the coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. 

Legend says that a goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans by observing that after being ingested by his goats they would become energetic an would not sleep at night.

Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.

### Spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula
Cultivation and trade of coffee began on the Arabian Peninsula in the #C15. It was not only enjoyed in homes but also in many public coffee houses (called *[[qahveh khaneh]]*) which were attended for all kinds of social activity.

With thousands of pilgrims visiting the holy city of Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby” began to spread.

### Coming to Europe
