# Alan Turing

He was shy, hesitant and with a high-pitched voice – not exactly stuttering, but hesitating, as if waiting for some laborious process to translate his thoughts into the form of human speech.

He was not interested in organising anyone, and did not wish to be organised by anyone else. He had escaped from one totalitarian system, and had no yearning for another.

He did not think of himself as placed in a superior category by virtue of his brains, and only insisted upon playing what happened to be his own special part.

 Science, to Alan Turing, was thinking for himself, and seeing for himself, and not a collection of facts. Science was doubting the axioms.



## Turing's Homosexuality
> "Alan Turing was homosexual – a fact that he took no particular pains to hide, especially as he grew older. For a boy growing up in the 1920s and for a grown man in the subsequent few decades, being homosexual – especially if one was British and a member of the upper classes – was an unmentionable, terrible, and mysterious affliction."
> (*Alan Turing: The Enigma*)

His openness to being a gay man came decades too early. His social life was a charade. Like any homosexual man, he was living an imitation game, not in the sense of conscious play-acting, but by being accepted as a person that he was not.
