# Lucid Dream
A lucid dream is a type of of [[dreams|dream]] in which the dreamer becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming, this means that the dreamer might gain some degree of control over the narrative of their dream and the dream world they find themselves in

Some [[psychology|psychological]] research suggests that lucid dreams can be utilised as a form of therapy.

Typically a lucid dream can be induced in one of two ways:
 1. Dream Induced Lucid Dream: Something within the dream triggers the dreamer to recognise that they are dreaming
 2. Wake Induced Lucid Dream: The dreamer falls asleep without the loss of awareness

The term was coined by Frederik Van Eeden who studied his own dreams, recording them in a dream diary, according to his records 352 dreams were categorised as lucid between Jan 20, 1898 and Dec 26, 1912.
He also named seven different types of dreams which he experienced based on the data he collected: 
1. Initial Dreams
2. Pathological Dreams
3. Ordinary Dreams
4. Vivid Dreams
5. Demoniacal Dreams
6. General Dream-Sensations
7. Lucid Dreams

The cultivation of lucidity during dreaming has been central to the Hindu practice of Yoga Nidra as well as the Tibetab Buddhist practice of dream Yoga. It was common pratcie among early Buddhists.
Similarly, references to lucid dreaming have been noted by Aristotle: "often when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream".
