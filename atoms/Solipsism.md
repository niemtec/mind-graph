**Solipsism** /ˈsɒlɪpsɪzəm/ from Latin _solus_ 'alone', and _ipse_ 'self'.

The idea that only your consciousness is real and everything else you experience only exists in your mind.

There are no other people, no other beings in the universe. There is no universe as you know it, it's all a figment of your imagination. The universe is continuously created as you observe it with your senses and is destroyed when you no longer do.

As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.
