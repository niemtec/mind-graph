# Caffeine
Caffeine has an  average [[half-life]] of 5-7 hours, the levels of caffeine peak approximately 30 minutes after oral administration.

The rate of caffeine clearance is affected by age; the older you are the longer it takes your body to filter out the caffeine from your system. As we age, we become more sensitive to caffeine's sleep-disturbing influence.
