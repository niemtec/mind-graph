# Philia
The fondness and appreciation of the other. It is not just friendship, but also loyalties to family, job or discipline. 

Philia for another may be motivated, as [[Aristotle]] explains in the Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII, for the agent’s sake or for the other’s own sake.

[[Aristotle]] elaborates on the kinds of things we seek in proper friendship, suggesting that the proper basis for philia is objective: those who share our dispositions, who bear no grudges, who seek what we do, who are temperate, and just, who admire us appropriately as we admire them.
