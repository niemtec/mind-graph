A school of [[philosophy]] founded by [[Zeno of Citium]] of Citium focussed on personal [[eudaemonic virtue ethics]] informed by its system of [[logic]] and views on natural world. The stoics identified the path to [[eudaimonia]] with a life spent practicing the [[cardinal virtues]] and living in accordance with nature.

Stoicism teaches that we can’t control or rely on anything outside what [[Epictetus]] called our “reasoned choice”—our ability to use our reason to choose how we categorise, respond, and reorient ourselves to external events.

Stoics ultimately framed their work around a series of exercises in three critical disciplines: 
1. **The Discipline of Perception**: how we see and perceive the world around us 
2. **The Discipline of Action**: the decisions and actions we take—and to what end
3. **The Discipline of Will**: how we deal with the things we cannot change, attain clear and convincing judgment, and come to a true understanding of our place in the world

The Stoics seek steadiness, stability, and tranquility—traits most of us aspire to but seem to experience only fleetingly.

## Perception
Stoicism teaches that one ought to control ones perceptions, since we cannot control the external world it is important to focus our attention on the only thing within our control which is how we see the world. 

> Today, you won’t control the external events that happen. Is that scary? A little, but it’s balanced when we see that we can control our opinion about those events. You decide whether they’re good or bad, whether they’re fair or unfair. You don’t control the situation, but you control what you think about it.

It's about filtering out the outside world through our judgement, taking the crooked and confusing nature of external events and making them orderly.
