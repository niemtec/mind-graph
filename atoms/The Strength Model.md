# The Strength Model
A model of [[Time Perception]] which posts taht a **memory trace** persists over time, by which one might judge the age of a [[memory]] and consequtively deduce how long ago the event occurred based on the strength of that trace.

(This conflicts with the fact that memories of recent events may fade more quickly than more distant ones)
