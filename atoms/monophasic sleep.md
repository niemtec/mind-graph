In monophasic [[sleep]], a person attains all of their [[sleep]] in one block of time, typically at night.

Researchers hypothesize that monophasic [[sleep]] became the dominant [[sleep]] pattern during the industrial era, when artificial lighting began enabling people to stay up past sunset. Prior to that, many people across different continents and cultures followed a [[biphasic sleep]] schedule.
