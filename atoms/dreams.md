# Dreams

Dreams introduce a state of [[temporal-distortion]] - a type of [[time]] dilation. [[Time]] doesn't behave in the same manner in dream state as it does in reality, most often it is percieved as elongated.

While your conscious mapping of [[time]] is lost during [[sleep]], at a non-conscious level, [[time]] continues to be cataloged by the [[brain]] with incredible [[precision]].
