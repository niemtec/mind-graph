Almanacs have been a long-running project which focussed on collecting and processing of information and ideas. The notebooks contained a variety of content ranging from reflection, through designs to lab notes from experiments.

They are numbered incrementally though not expected to be read in any particular order. The focus is placed on the content, not the chronological order of appearance.
