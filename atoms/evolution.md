# Evolution

Evolution is a behaviour that emerges in any system that has:
1. [[mutation]]
2. [[heredity]]
3. [[selection]]

---

[[evolutionary-systems]] often generate unexpected solutions. Nature selects for good enough.

If you really understand the theory of evolution, you accept that there is no [[soul]]. Evolution cannot accept the idea of [[soul]]s, at least if by "[[soul]]" you mean something indivisible, [[immutable]] and potentially eternal -- such an entity *cannot* be the result of step-by-step evolution. *Evolution means change*, and it is incapable of producing everlasing entities.
