# Evergreen Notes
Evergreen Notes are [[atomic]] notes written and organised to evolve, contribute and accumulate over time. They are part of a [[digital-garden]] which contains multiple interlinked [[atomic]] notes often referred to as "seeds".

**Principles of Evergreen Notes:**
  Evergreen Notes should be [[atomic]]
  They should be concept oriented
  The notes should be [[densely-linked]]

These principles are similar to [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann)â€™s [[zettelkasten]] method. There are subtle [[similarities-and-differences-between-evergreen-notes-and-zettelkasten]]
