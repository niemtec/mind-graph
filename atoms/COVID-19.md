## Effects on brain
An estimated 15-25% of patients with severe COVID-19 may experience neurological symptoms such as headaches, confusion, delirium, impaired consciousness, seizures, and strokes.

Systemic effects of the infection, such as inflammation, low oxygen levels, unusually “sticky” blood, and cardiac arrest, may play a role in [[EEG]] abnormalities that extend beyond the [[frontal lobe]]s.

Some people who have recovered from COVID-19 report ongoing health problems, now referred to as Long COVID, among these is [[brain fog]]. Authors of some [research papers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215863v1) suggest that COIVD might have aged people cognitively by around a decade.
