# Peace from Mind
When I say you want to be happy, what Iâ€™m actually saying is you want to find peace. We say peace of mind, but what we really want is [peace from mind](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1005107581289824256?lang=en).

The mind goes quiet during the moments of greatest pleasure. We seek the moment of peace from the voice inside our head.

At some point the mind became an uncontrollable master rather than a servant.

Our mind evolved to be paranoid, fearful and angry.
